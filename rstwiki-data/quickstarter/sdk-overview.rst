There 3 different ways to extend XApp-Studio and/or a mobile application. In either way, you have full control. The
only difference is that each way comes with its own structures and templates.

**`Plugins`** is the more flexible way to customize Quick-XApp-Studio, XApp-Studio or the mobile application. There is no obligation to develop for each level.

**`Custom Application`** is optimized for extending a mobile application only.

**`XApp-Connect-Drivers`** are optimized to extend all layers, "Quick-XApp-Studio", "XApp-Studio" and "XApp-Mobile" for a new custom data source.

Plugins enable to extend all layers:

- Quick-XApp

When writing a plugin, XApp-Studio provides Javascript templates for each level which also contain a minimal sample code to get started.

**Requirements :**

* Javascript expertise
* A basic understanding of Dojo. No worry, the provided templates will help you to get rid of it.

**How do does it work :**
